Hi, Im John.
Im a simple country boy that wants a computer job.
I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics 
from The University of Florida.
I'm interested in bicycles, socialism, and making 
things on the computer.
I want to learn about building websites, e-commerce,
independent manufacturing and home farming.
I speak and write English expertly and can read a 
little French.
Please leave me a message if you  enjoyed learning
a little about me
